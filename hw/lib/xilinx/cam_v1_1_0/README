Follow the instruction below to create a TCAM IP for NetFPGA NFPLUS platform step by step. The TCAM IPs created by the instruction is based on SRL only to support Ternary mode. More detailed information of the TCAM can be found on xapp1151_Param_CAM.pdf in Xilinx web site. TCAM IPs on NFPLUS platform are separated into TCAM and CAM, but they are almost the same and share the same libraries.

1) At first, users need to find and download xapp1151 module on Xilinx web site. After searching 'xapp1151', xapp1151_Param_CAM.zip and related documents can be downloaded from the web site.

2) Copy xapp1151_Param_CAM.zip into the NetFPGA-NFPLUS-live/lib/hw/xilinx/cores/cam_v*_*_*/ and go to the 'cam_v*_*_*' directory.

3) Run 'make update' to decompress and update the xapp1151 libraries.

4) Run 'make sim' and find what is the simulation result. Before run 'make sim', source Vivado license to run the tool commands.

5) Run 'make' to create IP.


If it is succeeded, now users can call the TCAM IP in the project for block design and ip creation.

(Note: Whenever you run 'make clean' in the $NFPLUS_FOLDER, you need to run again 'make' into cam_v*_*_* folder, to create the IP.)
